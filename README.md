# 👨‍💻 Tendo Calvin | Aspiring Software Engineer

Welcome to my GitHub! I’m currently on an exciting journey to master **Node.js** and become a well-rounded **software engineer**, one step at a time. This space documents my learning, growth, and the tools I’m exploring along the way.

---

## 🚀 My Current Focus: Node.js

I’m diving deep into **Node.js**, exploring how to build efficient, scalable, and production-ready backend applications. My journey includes:

- 🌐 Understanding core modules (HTTP, FS, Events)
- 📦 Working with NPM packages & Express.js
- 🔐 Building RESTful APIs with proper authentication & security
- 💾 Connecting to databases (MongoDB, PostgreSQL)
- 🧪 Writing tests for robustness and reliability
- ⚙️ Deploying full-stack applications to the cloud

> 📘 I'm using resources like **The Odin Project**, **freeCodeCamp**, **Node.js docs**, and hands-on project work.

## 🧱 Node.js Stack Roadmap

Here is the full Node.js stack I aim to cover as part of my full backend development journey:

### 📌 **Core Node.js**
- Node.js architecture & event loop
- Global objects and built-in modules (fs, http, path, etc.)
- Package management with npm and yarn
- Module systems (CommonJS & ESModules)

### ⚙️ **Backend Frameworks**
- Express.js (RESTful APIs)
- NestJS (modular architecture)
- Fastify (performance-oriented server framework)

### 🔐 **Authentication & Authorization**
- Password hashing (bcrypt)
- Sessions and cookies
- JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- OAuth 2.0 integration (Google, GitHub login)

### 💾 **Databases**
- MongoDB with Mongoose (NoSQL)
- PostgreSQL with Sequelize/Prisma (SQL)
- Redis (caching and sessions)

### 📡 **API Design**
- RESTful API principles
- CRUD operations
- API versioning and documentation (Swagger / Postman)

### 🧪 **Testing**
- Unit testing with Jest
- Integration testing with Supertest
- Test coverage & mocking

### 🛰️ **DevOps & Deployment**
- Environment variables & dotenv
- Deployment with Render, Railway, Vercel, or Heroku
- Docker basics
- CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions)

### 📦 **Additional Tools**
- Rate limiting, CORS, Helmet for security
- Multer for file uploads
- Nodemailer for sending emails
- WebSockets with Socket.io for real-time communication
